            Established in 2021 by Evan Scully, Scully Aerial Photography is an aerial photography business located in mostly is Massachusetts and Rhode Island. This website will be another version of the current website which is under construction, and will include multiple pages which can be mostly found in the nav bar. Futhermore, some of these pages will be named: "Portfolio," "Services," "Real Estate," "Marine," "Events," "Mapping," "Cinematography," "About," and "Contact." Each of these pages will contain content regarding the name of the page, including photos and videos for most of them. I will have a list (li) in the nav that goes by the order: Home | Portfolio | Services (ul) | About | Contact . Inside "Services" will be sub pages: Real Estate | Marine | Events | Mapping | Cinematography . The current theme on the page is temporary and will most likely be changed to a grayscale theme.
